    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part One\n",
    "\n",
    "The sea floor is getting steeper. Maybe the sleigh keys got carried this way?\n",
    "\n",
    "A massive school of glowing [lanternfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanternfish) swims past. They must spawn quickly to reach such large numbers - maybe _exponentially_ quickly? You should model their growth rate to be sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although you know nothing about this specific species of lanternfish, you make some guesses about their attributes. Surely, <span title=\"I heard you like lanternfish.\">each lanternfish creates a new lanternfish</span> once every _7_ days.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this process isn't necessarily synchronized between every lanternfish - one lanternfish might have 2 days left until it creates another lanternfish, while another might have 4. So, you can model each fish as a single number that represents _the number of days until it creates a new lanternfish_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, you reason, a _new_ lanternfish would surely need slightly longer before it's capable of producing more lanternfish: two more days for its first cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, suppose you have a lanternfish with an internal timer value of `3`:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   After one day, its internal timer would become `2`.\n",
    "*   After another day, its internal timer would become `1`.\n",
    "*   After another day, its internal timer would become `0`.\n",
    "*   After another day, its internal timer would reset to `6`, and it would create a _new_ lanternfish with an internal timer of `8`.\n",
    "*   After another day, the first lanternfish would have an internal timer of `5`, and the second lanternfish would have an internal timer of `7`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lanternfish that creates a new fish resets its timer to `6`, _not `7`_ (because `0` is included as a valid timer value). The new lanternfish starts with an internal timer of `8` and does not start counting down until the next day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Realizing what you're trying to do, the submarine automatically produces a list of the ages of several hundred nearby lanternfish (your puzzle input). For example, suppose you were given the following list:\n",
    "\n",
    "    3,4,3,1,2\n",
    "\n",
    "This list means that the first fish has an internal timer of `3`, the second fish has an internal timer of `4`, and so on until the fifth fish, which has an internal timer of `2`. Simulating these fish over several days would proceed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Initial state: 3,4,3,1,2\n",
    "    After  1 day:  2,3,2,0,1\n",
    "    After  2 days: 1,2,1,6,0,8\n",
    "    After  3 days: 0,1,0,5,6,7,8\n",
    "    After  4 days: 6,0,6,4,5,6,7,8,8\n",
    "    After  5 days: 5,6,5,3,4,5,6,7,7,8\n",
    "    After  6 days: 4,5,4,2,3,4,5,6,6,7\n",
    "    After  7 days: 3,4,3,1,2,3,4,5,5,6\n",
    "    After  8 days: 2,3,2,0,1,2,3,4,4,5\n",
    "    After  9 days: 1,2,1,6,0,1,2,3,3,4,8\n",
    "    After 10 days: 0,1,0,5,6,0,1,2,2,3,7,8\n",
    "    After 11 days: 6,0,6,4,5,6,0,1,1,2,6,7,8,8,8\n",
    "    After 12 days: 5,6,5,3,4,5,6,0,0,1,5,6,7,7,7,8,8\n",
    "    After 13 days: 4,5,4,2,3,4,5,6,6,0,4,5,6,6,6,7,7,8,8\n",
    "    After 14 days: 3,4,3,1,2,3,4,5,5,6,3,4,5,5,5,6,6,7,7,8\n",
    "    After 15 days: 2,3,2,0,1,2,3,4,4,5,2,3,4,4,4,5,5,6,6,7\n",
    "    After 16 days: 1,2,1,6,0,1,2,3,3,4,1,2,3,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,8\n",
    "    After 17 days: 0,1,0,5,6,0,1,2,2,3,0,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,7,8\n",
    "    After 18 days: 6,0,6,4,5,6,0,1,1,2,6,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,6,7,8,8,8,8\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each day, a `0` becomes a `6` and adds a new `8` to the end of the list, while each other number decreases by 1 if it was present at the start of the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, after 18 days, there are a total of `26` fish. After 80 days, there would be a total of _`5934`_.\n",
