My solutions for the 2021 Advent Of Code puzzles

This code is very much the first thing I thought of to solve each problem. Advent Of Code rarely
rewards code written to solve a problem in the cleanest way: brute force is much more likely
to give an answer quickly, at least for the early problems.

The folder `src/` contains the original scripts I wrote (the first few days have no scripts because I just
used the Python repl. The folder `input` has the puzzle input, and in some cases the sample input
given in the problem description as well.

Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files) in this folder contain the puzzle together with the solutions and perhaps some
comments.
