    "As you leave the cave and reach open waters, you receive a transmission from the Elves back on the ship.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transmission was sent using the Buoyancy Interchange Transmission System (<span title=\"Just be glad it wasn't sent using the BuoyancY Transmission Encoding System.\">BITS</span>), a method of packing numeric expressions into a binary sequence. Your submarine's computer has saved the transmission in [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) (your puzzle input).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of decoding the message is to convert the hexadecimal representation into binary. Each character of hexadecimal corresponds to four bits of binary data:\n",

    "    0 = 0000\n",

    "    2 = 0010\n",
    "    3 = 0011\n",
    "    4 = 0100\n",
    "    5 = 0101\n",
    "    6 = 0110\n",
    "    7 = 0111\n",
    "    8 = 1000\n",
    "    9 = 1001\n",
    "    A = 1010\n",
    "    B = 1011\n",
    "    C = 1100\n",
    "    D = 1101\n",

    "    F = 1111\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The BITS transmission contains a single _packet_ at its outermost layer which itself contains many other packets. The hexadecimal representation of this packet might encode a few extra `0` bits at the end; these are not part of the transmission and should be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every packet begins with a standard header: the first three bits encode the packet _version_, and the next three bits encode the packet _type ID_. These two values are numbers; all numbers encoded in any packet are represented as binary with the most significant bit first. For example, a version encoded as the binary sequence `100` represents the number `4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Packets with type ID `4` represent a _literal value_. Literal value packets encode a single binary number. To do this, the binary number is padded with leading zeroes until its length is a multiple of four bits, and then it is broken into groups of four bits. Each group is prefixed by a `1` bit except the last group, which is prefixed by a `0` bit. These groups of five bits immediately follow the packet header. For example, the hexadecimal string `D2FE28` becomes:\n",

    "    VVVTTTAAAAABBBBBCCCCC\n",

    "\n",
    "Below each bit is a label indicating its purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The three bits labeled `V` (`110`) are the packet version, `6`.\n",
    "*   The three bits labeled `T` (`100`) are the packet type ID, `4`, which means the packet is a literal value.\n",
    "*   The five bits labeled `A` (`10111`) start with a `1` (not the last group, keep reading) and contain the first four bits of the number, `0111`.\n",
    "*   The five bits labeled `B` (`11110`) start with a `1` (not the last group, keep reading) and contain four more bits of the number, `1110`.\n",
    "*   The five bits labeled `C` (`00101`) start with a `0` (last group, end of packet) and contain the last four bits of the number, `0101`.\n",
    "*   The three unlabeled `0` bits at the end are extra due to the hexadecimal representation and should be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, this packet represents a literal value with binary representation `011111100101`, which is `2021` in decimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every other type of packet (any packet with a type ID other than `4`) represent an _operator_ that performs some calculation on one or more sub-packets contained within. Right now, the specific operations aren't important; focus on parsing the hierarchy of sub-packets.\n",
    "\n",
    "An operator packet contains one or more packets. To indicate which subsequent binary data represents its sub-packets, an operator packet can use one of two modes indicated by the bit immediately after the packet header; this is called the _length type ID_:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   If the length type ID is `0`, then the next _15_ bits are a number that represents the _total length in bits_ of the sub-packets contained by this packet.\n",
    "*   If the length type ID is `1`, then the next _11_ bits are a number that represents the _number of sub-packets immediately contained_ by this packet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, after the length type ID bit and the 15-bit or 11-bit field, the sub-packets appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here is an operator packet (hexadecimal string `38006F45291200`) with length type ID `0` that contains two sub-packets:\n",

    "*   The bit labeled `I` (`0`) is the length type ID, which indicates that the length is a 15-bit number representing the number of bits in the sub-packets.\n",
    "*   The 15 bits labeled `L` (`000000000011011`) contain the length of the sub-packets in bits, `27`.\n",

    "*   The 16 bits labeled `B` contain the second sub-packet, a literal value representing the number `20`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After reading 11 and 16 bits of sub-packet data, the total length indicated in `L` (27) is reached, and so parsing of this packet stops.\n",

    "*   The three bits labeled `V` (`111`) are the packet version, `7`.\n",
    "*   The three bits labeled `T` (`011`) are the packet type ID, `3`, which means the packet is an operator.\n",
