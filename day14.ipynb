    "# Day 14: Extended Polymerization\n",
    "\n",
    "[https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/14](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/14)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part One\n",
    "\n",
    "The incredible pressures at this depth are starting to put a strain on your submarine. The submarine has [polymerization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerization) equipment that would produce suitable materials to reinforce the submarine, and the nearby volcanically-active caves should even have the necessary input elements in sufficient quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The submarine manual contains <span title=\"HO\n",
    "\n",
    "HO -> OH\">instructions</span> for finding the optimal polymer formula; specifically, it offers a _polymer template_ and a list of _pair insertion_ rules (your puzzle input). You just need to work out what polymer would result after repeating the pair insertion process a few times.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    NNCB\n",
    "\n",
    "    CH -> B\n",
    "    HH -> N\n",
    "    CB -> H\n",
    "    NH -> C\n",
    "    HB -> C\n",
    "    HC -> B\n",
    "    HN -> C\n",
    "    NN -> C\n",
    "    BH -> H\n",
    "    NC -> B\n",
    "    NB -> B\n",
    "    BN -> B\n",
    "    BB -> N\n",
    "    BC -> B\n",
    "    CC -> N\n",
    "    CN -> C\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line is the _polymer template_ - this is the starting point of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following section defines the _pair insertion_ rules. A rule like `AB -> C` means that when elements `A` and `B` are immediately adjacent, element `C` should be inserted between them. These insertions all happen simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, starting with the polymer template `NNCB`, the first step simultaneously considers all three pairs:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The first pair (`NN`) matches the rule `NN -> C`, so element _`C`_ is inserted between the first `N` and the second `N`.\n",
    "*   The second pair (`NC`) matches the rule `NC -> B`, so element _`B`_ is inserted between the `N` and the `C`.\n",
    "*   The third pair (`CB`) matches the rule `CB -> H`, so element _`H`_ is inserted between the `C` and the `B`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these pairs overlap: the second element of one pair is the first element of the next pair. Also, because all pairs are considered simultaneously, inserted elements are not considered to be part of a pair until the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the first step of this process, the polymer becomes `NCNBCHB`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the results of a few steps using the above rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Template:     NNCB\n",
    "    After step 1: NCNBCHB\n",
    "    After step 2: NBCCNBBBCBHCB\n",
    "    After step 3: NBBBCNCCNBBNBNBBCHBHHBCHB\n",
    "    After step 4: NBBNBNBBCCNBCNCCNBBNBBNBBBNBBNBBCBHCBHHNHCBBCBHCB\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This polymer grows quickly. After step 5, it has length 97; After step 10, it has length 3073. After step 10, `B` occurs 1749 times, `C` occurs 298 times, `H` occurs 161 times, and `N` occurs 865 times; taking the quantity of the most common element (`B`, 1749) and subtracting the quantity of the least common element (`H`, 161) produces `1749 - 161 = 1588`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply 10 steps of pair insertion to the polymer template and find the most and least common elements in the result. _What do you get if you take the quantity of the most common element and subtract the quantity of the least common element?_"
